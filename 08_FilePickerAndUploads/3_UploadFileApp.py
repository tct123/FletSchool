'''
Theory:

File picker has built-in upload capabilities that work on all platforms and the web.

To upload one or more files you should call FilePicker.pick_files() first. 
hen the files are selected by the user they are not automatically uploaded anywhere,
but instead their references are kept in the file picker state.

To perform an actual upload you should call FilePicker.upload() method and pass 
the list of files that need to be uploaded along with their upload URLs and upload 
method (PUT or POST).
